## Welcome to Geareg

Geareg came out of my passion for reviewing bags and other EDC products. If the names like Goruck, TAD, TomBihn make any sense to you, this is your tribe. This application / website lets me:

- build a database of bags and other products
- share photos of these bags from owners like myself
- maintain a personal database of bags that I owned, keeping tabs of my buy and sell activities, how much money I spent
- list bags for sale

## The Bag Database

The bag database is the hardest part of building this website. I curate this by hand from all the bags that I owned. It requires collecting
information like dimension and weights, manufacturers website link, online reviews, and more.

## The Photos

All the photos are submitted by members of this site. If you upload an appropriate photo, they will be randomly shared to anyone viewing
these products.

## Your Personal Database

You can create your personal database of any bags on the site, adding private information only available to yourself, like buy sell dates and
prices.

### Status of your bag

This is an important field that you control. You can use one of these status at one time:

- current: You own this bag
- selling: You own this bag and want to sell it
- sold: You sold this bag
- grail: You are looking for this bag

## Who Owns the Data / Who sees your data

Any data you entered specific to your own bag is yours and the public or other member do not see them except:

- The status of your bag is shared with others. For example we want to know what bags are for sale!
- Sell price (asking price) is obviously shared, as well as any text that you entered
- Photos that you added are shared

If you want your data removed, just contact the administrator. They can remove all data by bag entry.
Note that all data are accessible to the administrator team for product support.

If you want those removed, just let the admin know.

## I want In!

So happy you want to be part of this project. Currently this product is in a close beta state.
